BugChecker is a SoftICE-like kernel and user debugger for Windows 11 (and Windows XP as well: it supports Windows versions from XP to 11, both x86 and x64). 
BugChecker doesn't require a second machine to be connected to the system being debugged, like in the case of WinDbg and KD.
This version of BugChecker (unlike the original version developed 20 years ago) leverages the internal and undocumented KD API in NTOSKRNL. 
KD API allows WinDbg/KD to do calls like read/write virtual memory, read/write registers, place a breakpoint at an address etc.

ETW Integrity Hunting Tip: Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing publisher
" One thing that I stumbled upon which I haven't seen before was if I messed with the registry key associated with Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing publisher, 
I could stop the security log from logging those pesky 4688s and 4624s even after a reboot without disabling the EventLog Service. In this case, our detection opportunity is now EID 1108 and 1107 (depending on the version of Windows) in the Security log.

So if you find those EID's in your environment, check Sec publisher registry key and make sure it hasn't been tampered with. Happy hunting, fam! "
